# Call of Cthulhu

## Background
In "Call of Cthulhu", players enter a mysterious and chaotic world inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Players 
navigate through various rooms on a 5x5 game board, each holding its own darkness. Players will be set in a 
Lovecraftian universe where they encounter totems, runes, and players might encounter Madness they need 
to fight with and the Prophet they can learn runes from.

### Starting the Game
On launching the game, players are prompted to enter a username. 
They can then choose to start a new game or continue from a saved state. 
The game progresses in days (levels), each presenting new challenges. 
The ultimate goal is to live to Day 3; reach (4,4); and win the boss fight.
